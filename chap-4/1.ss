;; *Exercise 4.1:* Notice that we cannot tell whether the
;; metacircular evaluator evaluates operands from left to right or
;; from right to left.  Its evaluation order is inherited from the
;; underlying Lisp: If the arguments to `cons' in `list-of-values'
;; are evaluated from left to right, then `list-of-values' will
;; evaluate operands from left to right; and if the arguments to
;; `cons' are evaluated from right to left, then `list-of-values'
;; will evaluate operands from right to left.

;; Write a version of `list-of-values' that evaluates operands from
;; left to right regardless of the order of evaluation in the
;; underlying Lisp.  Also write a version of `list-of-values' that
;; evaluates operands from right to left.
